    And I set the following fields to these values:
      | Enable completion tracking 	| Yes |
    And I press "Save and display"
    And I turn editing mode on
    And I add a "label" activity to course "RefCourse" section "1" and I fill the form with:
      | Text   | Just a simple module to activate progress tracking |
      | Students must manually mark the activity as done | 1 |
    And I turn editing mode off
    And I navigate to "Setup > Gradebook setup" in the course gradebook
    And the following "grade items" exist:
      | itemname      | grademax | course |

    And I turn editing mode on
    And I give the grade "5" to the user "Student 1" for the grade item "Manual item 1"
    And I press "Save"
    And I turn editing mode off
